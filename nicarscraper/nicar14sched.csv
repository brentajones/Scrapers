Lyra: Custom visualization design without programming;Arvind Satyanarayan;Salon A;Saturday;4 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.;"Lyra is an interactive environment that enables custom visualization design without writing any code. Visualizations are built by composing graphical ""marks"" such as rectangles, arcs, lines, and text. These marks can be bound to data fields using property drop zones; dynamically positioned using connectors; and directly moved, rotated, and resized using handles. Lyra also provides a data pipeline interface for iterative visual specification of data transformations and layout algorithms. Lyra is more expressive than interactive systems like Tableau, allowing designers to create custom visualizations comparable to hand-coded visualizations created using D3 or Processing. These visualizations can then be easily published and reused on the Web."
