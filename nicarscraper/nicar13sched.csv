Inside baseball: What data journalism can learn from sports;Ryan Pitts, Matthew Waite, Jeremy Bowers;Regency North;Saturday;10 a.m. - 10:50 a.m.;"This panel will identify areas for data journalism exploration by examining the current state-of-the-art baseball data analysis. Sports are the original form of data journalism -- box scores predate open government movements by about a century. And Joseph Adler's ""Baseball Hacks"" trained newbie Web CAR reporters how to scrape and analyze data sets using Perl and MySQL. Finally, sports analytics are a leading indicator for other kinds of analysis. Sensors, economic analysis, leverage are all de rigeur in baseball but still up-and-coming in data journalism. We'll take the concepts being used to analyze baseball, football, soccer and apply them to standard data journalism chores. A good example of this is leverage -- in baseball, an analyst attempts to find those situations in which a player had the greatest opportunity to change the outcome of a game. In data journalism, we might use a similar tool to analyze critical paths to an election win for a candidate or put together a network graph for bundled contributions to PACs."

How to edit a news app;Scott Klein, Aron Pilhofer;Regency South;Saturday;11 a.m. - 11:50 a.m.;There's a lot to think about when it comes to news apps, but not all of it is coding. What story is it telling? Does it tell it consistently and in a fact-based way? Does the story it tells agree with the reporting (and if not who's got explaining to do!) What's the lede, what's the nut (yes, apps have those).
