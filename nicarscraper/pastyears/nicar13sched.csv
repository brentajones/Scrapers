Finding the bad guys: Tricks for joining lists of people;Adam Playford, Michael LaForgia;Churchill Downs;Friday;4 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.;Identifying people who appear in two databases can give an investigation sweep and take it to the next level: think about matching camp operators and sex offenders, or felons and almost anything. But such joins are difficult and time-consuming, particularly if you have names but not dates of birth. Learn techniques to sidestep those issues by combining your favorite database software with simple scripting and some old-fashioned reporting. By the end of the session, you'll know how to match messy addresses and how to highlight promising hits based on name alone -- exactly what you need to find some bad guys and beef-up your next project.

Talk of an ""income gap"" ""or the 99%"" obscures a complicated reality and ignores most of the story - trends in the middle class. Income inequality is growing in many places, shrinking in others. Its pace and texture vary. Some causes are global and national, some are local. Come learn better ways to cover a complex story, including how journalists did recent stories and data tools you can use to analyze local trends."

Inside baseball: What data journalism can learn from sports;Ryan Pitts, Matthew Waite, Jeremy Bowers;Regency North;Saturday;10 a.m. - 10:50 a.m.;"This panel will identify areas for data journalism exploration by examining the current state-of-the-art baseball data analysis. Sports are the original form of data journalism -- box scores predate open government movements by about a century. And Joseph Adler's ""Baseball Hacks"" trained newbie Web CAR reporters how to scrape and analyze data sets using Perl and MySQL. Finally, sports analytics are a leading indicator for other kinds of analysis. Sensors, economic analysis, leverage are all de rigeur in baseball but still up-and-coming in data journalism. We'll take the concepts being used to analyze baseball, football, soccer and apply them to standard data journalism chores. A good example of this is leverage -- in baseball, an analyst attempts to find those situations in which a player had the greatest opportunity to change the outcome of a game. In data journalism, we might use a similar tool to analyze critical paths to an election win for a candidate or put together a network graph for bundled contributions to PACs."
